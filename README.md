## BaryaBazaar - SaaS P2P Trading Platform for USDT and PHP

## Overview
BaryaBazaar is a comprehensive SaaS platform for peer-to-peer (P2P) trading of USDT and PHP, tailored for organizations and individual users in the Philippines. It evolves from the core Coinmate application, which serves as the flagship and first organization within the platform. Coinmate's fully developed features form the foundation of BaryaBazaar, enabling efficient cryptocurrency trading operations with advanced management tools. As a SaaS solution, BaryaBazaar supports multiple organizations through white-labeling, allowing custom branding and settings while operating on a freemium modelâ€”all core features are free, with premium AI-enhanced capabilities planned for future release. This merger integrates Coinmate's robust trading engine, analytics, and security into a scalable multi-tenant system, where Coinmate operates as one of many organizations leveraging BaryaBazaar's infrastructure.

## Features
- **Freemium Model**: All core features are free; premium AI features (e.g., predictive trading insights and automated risk alerts) are in development.
- **Multi-Organization Support**: Manage multiple organizations with separate branding, settings, and data isolation; Coinmate is the initial organization demonstrating full capabilities.
- **Enhanced Trading Interface**: Execute BUY/SELL transactions with real-time validation, rate calculation, balance checks, and P2P API support for Bybit, OKX, and Binance to pull PHP/USDT ads for analysis.
- **Transaction Management**: Track and manage trading activities, including internal transfers, with export to CSV/PDF.
- **User Management**: Superadmin oversees users, roles, and bank assignments across organizations.
- **Balance Management**: Track and adjust PHP and USDT balances for users and platforms.
- **End of Day Processing**: Automated profit collection and report generation.
- **HR Tracking**: Monitor user sessions and work hours.
- **Advanced Analytics**: KPI monitoring, user performance analysis, predictive forecasting, and risk assessment.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical roles (Super Admin, Admin, Supervisor, Analyst) with granular permissions.
- **White Labeling**: Customize logos, colors, and themes per organization.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts via Telegram, Slack, and Microsoft Teams.
- **Security Monitoring**: Suspicious activity detection, audit logs, and encrypted data storage.
- **P2P Trading**: Users trade USDT and PHP directly, with secure login and organization selection.

## Technical Architecture
